All of my quant stuff that I have ever needed till now. Will be pushing new stuff as I create them. All functions and KPIs are coded from scratch for my own learning purposes, and everything is organised into different folders. Backtests contain real world backtesting of data and you are free to explore the strategies and tweak and backtest them in your own way. Will keep this open source for now since it's very basic stuff, which should hopefully be cake for any entry level quant.
